# Aurora Mail App

Aurora Mail allows mobile access to mailboxes served by the Afterlogic WebMail product family. It relies on Aurora API and can't work with the mail server directly. This app enables you to perform all essential mail operations like viewing, composing, and sending emails including PGP encrypted emails.
